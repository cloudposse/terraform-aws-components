# This Terraform configuration file which creates a customer-managed policy exists in both aws-teams and aws-team-roles.
#
# The reason for this is as follows:
#
# The support role (unlike most roles in the identity account) needs specific access to
# resources in the identity account. Policies must be created per-account, so the identity
# account needs a support policy, and that has to be created in aws-teams.
#
# Other custom roles are only needed in either the identity or the other accounts, not both.
