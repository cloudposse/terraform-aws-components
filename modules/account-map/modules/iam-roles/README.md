# Submodule `iam-roles`

This submodule is used by other modules to determine which IAM Roles
or AWS CLI Config Profiles to use for various tasks, most commonly
for applying Terraform plans.

## Special Configuration Needed

In order to avoid having to pass customization information through every module
that uses this submodule, if the default configuration does not suit your needs,
you are expected to add `variables_override.tf` to override the variables with
the defaults you want to use in your project. For example, if you are not using
"core" as the `tenant` portion of your "root" account (your Organization Management Account),
then you should include the `variable "overridable_global_tenant_name"` declaration
in your `variables_override.tf` so that `overridable_global_tenant_name` defaults
to the value you are using (or the empty string if you are not using `tenant` at all).
