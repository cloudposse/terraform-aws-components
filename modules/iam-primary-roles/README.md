# Component: `iam-primary-roles`

This component is responsible for provisioning all primary user and system roles into the centralized identity account. This is expected to be use alongside [the `iam-delegated-roles` component](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/master/modules/iam-delegated-roles)Â to provide fine grained role delegation across the account hierarchy.

## Usage

**Stack Level**: Global

Here's an example snippet for how to use this component. The component should only be applied once, which is typically done via the identity stack (e.g. `gbl-identity.yaml`).

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    iam-primary-roles:
      vars:
        # When assume_role_restricted is true, assuming other roles in the identity
        # account is restricted based on the role configuration, but that can only
        # be set up after the roles are created. When the roles do not yet exist,
        # such as during cold start, set assume_role_restricted false, and all
        # roles will be able to assume other roles.
        assume_role_restricted: true

        # AWS SSO assigns users to unpredictable roles, so we cannot whitelist them
        # and must by default allow other roles in the identity account to assume
        # the identity roles, relying on their own IAM restrictions to limit them.
        default_assume_role_enabled: true

        primary_account_id: "xxxxxxxxxxxx" # `identity` account

        # The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the IAM roles.
        # If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default maximum of one hour is applied.
        # This setting can have a value from 3600 (1 hour) to 43200 (12 hours)
        iam_role_max_session_duration: 43200

        # delegated_ roles_config is not just the set of roles for the identity account, it is
        # also the template for roles in all other "delegated" accounts.
        #
        # The role_policy_arn defines the policy for that role in the identity account,
        # which is why, for example, poweruser has ViewOnlyAccess. The policy for the
        # role in the delegated accounts is set in the iam-delegated-roles project.
        #
        # The trusted_primary_roles list indicates which roles in identity are allowed
        # to access those roles. So "ops" can access "poweruser", for example.
        delegated_roles_config:
          admin:
            role_policy_arns: [ "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess" ]
            role_description: "Role with AdministratorAccess permissions"
            sso_login_enabled: true
            # list of roles in primary that can assume into this role in delegated accounts
            # primary admin can assume delegated admin
            trusted_primary_roles: [ "admin" ]

          ops:
            role_policy_arns: [ "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess" ]
            role_description: "Role for OPS personnel"
            sso_login_enabled: true
            trusted_primary_roles: [ "admin", "ops" ]

          poweruser:
            role_policy_arns:
              - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess"
              - "delegated_assume_role"
            role_description: "Role for Power Users (read/write)"
            sso_login_enabled: true
            trusted_primary_roles: [ "admin", "ops", "poweruser" ]

          observer:
            role_policy_arns:

            sso_login_enabled: true
            trusted_primary_roles: [ "admin", "ops", "observer" ]

          terraform:
            role_policy_arns:
              - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess"
              - "delegated_assume_role"
            role_description: "Role with permissions for terraform automation"
            sso_login_enabled: false
            # Terraform is too powerful a role to allow powerusers to access it
            trusted_primary_roles: [ "admin", "ops", "cicd", "terraform" ]

          helm:
            role_policy_arns:
              - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess"
              - "delegated_assume_role"
            role_description: "Role with permissions for helm automation"
            sso_login_enabled: false
            # Helm is too powerful a role to allow powerusers to access it
            trusted_primary_roles: [ "admin", "ops", "cicd", "helm" ]

        # primary_roles_config is for roles that only appear in the identity account.
        # Users or services log in with one of these roles and assume
        # delegated roles in other accounts.
        primary_roles_config:
          cicd:
            role_policy_arns: [ "cicd" ]
            role_description: "Role for our privileged CI/CD Runner"
            sso_login_enabled: false
            trusted_primary_roles: [ "admin", "ops" ]
