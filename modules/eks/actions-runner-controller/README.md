### Generating Required Secrets

AWS SSM is used to store and retrieve secrets.

Decide on the SSM path for the GitHub secret (PAT or Application private key) and GitHub webhook secret.

Since the secret is automatically scoped by AWS to the account and region where the secret is stored, we recommend the
secret be stored at `/github_runners/controller_github_app_secret` unless you plan on running multiple instances of the
controller. If you plan on running multiple instances of the controller, and want to give them different access
(otherwise they could share the same secret), then you can add a path component to the SSM path. For example
`/github_runners/cicd/controller_github_app_secret`.

```
ssm_github_secret_path: "/github_runners/controller_github_app_secret"
```

The preferred way to authenticate is by _creating_ and _installing_ a GitHub App. This is the recommended approach as it
allows for more much more restricted access than using a personal access token, at least until
[fine-grained personal access token permissions](https://github.blog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-for-github/)
are generally available. Follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/detailed-docs.md#deploying-using-github-app-authentication)
to create and install the GitHub App.

At the creation stage, you will be asked to generate a private key. This is the private key that will be used to
authenticate the Action Runner Controller. Download the file and store the contents in SSM using the following command,
adjusting the profile and file name. The profile should be the `admin` role in the account to which you are deploying
the runner controller. The file name should be the name of the private key file you downloaded.

```
AWS_PROFILE=acme-mgmt-use2-auto-admin chamber write github_runners controller_github_app_secret -- "$(cat APP_NAME.DATE.private-key.pem)"
```

You can verify the file was correctly written to SSM by matching the private key fingerprint reported by GitHub with:

```
AWS_PROFILE=acme-mgmt-use2-auto-admin chamber read -q github_runners controller_github_app_secret | openssl rsa -in - -pubout -outform DER | openssl sha256 -binary | openssl base64
```

At this stage, record the Application ID and the private key fingerprint in your secrets manager (e.g. 1Password). You
will need the Application ID to configure the runner controller, and want the fingerprint to verify the private key.

Proceed to install the GitHub App in the organization or repository you want to use the runner controller for, and
record the Installation ID (the final numeric part of the URL, as explained in the instructions linked above) in your
secrets manager. You will need the Installation ID to configure the runner controller.

In your stack configuration, set the following variables, making sure to quote the values so they are treated as
strings, not numbers.

```
github_app_id: "12345"
github_app_installation_id: "12345"
```

OR (obsolete)

- A PAT with the scope outlined in
  [this document](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller#deploying-using-pat-authentication).
  Save this to the value specified by `ssm_github_token_path` using the following command, adjusting the AWS_PROFILE to
  refer to the `admin` role in the account to which you are deploying the runner controller:

```
AWS_PROFILE=acme-mgmt-use2-auto-admin chamber write github_runners controller_github_app_secret -- "<PAT>"
```

2. If using the Webhook Driven autoscaling (recommended), generate a random string to use as the Secret when creating
   the webhook in GitHub.

Generate the string using 1Password (no special characters, length 45) or by running

```bash
dd if=/dev/random bs=1 count=33  2>/dev/null | base64
```

Store this key in AWS SSM under the same path specified by `ssm_github_webhook_secret_token_path`

```
ssm_github_webhook_secret_token_path: "/github_runners/github_webhook_secret"
```

### Dockerhub Authentication

Authenticating with Dockerhub is optional but when enabled can ensure stability by increasing the number of pulls
allowed from your runners.

To get started set `docker_config_json_enabled` to `true` and `ssm_docker_config_json_path` to the SSM path where the
credentials are stored, for example `github_runners/docker`.

To create the credentials file, fill out a JSON file locally with the following content:

```json
{
  "auths": {
    "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
      "username": "your_username",
      "password": "your_password",
      "email": "your_email",
      "auth": "$(echo "your_username: your_password" | base64)"
    }
  }
}
```

Then write the file to SSM with the following Atmos Workflow:

```yaml
save/docker-config-json:
  description: Prompt for uploading Docker Config JSON to the AWS SSM Parameter Store
  steps:
    - type: shell
      command: |-
        echo "Please enter the Docker Config JSON file path"
        echo "See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry for information on how to create the file"
        read -p "Docker Config JSON file path: " -r DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON_FILE_PATH
        if [ -z "DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON_FILE_PATH" ]
        then
            echo 'Inputs cannot be blank please try again!'
            exit 0
        fi

        DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON=$(<$DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON_FILE_PATH);
        ENCODED_DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON=$(echo "$DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON" | base64 -w 0 );

        echo $DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON
        echo $ENCODED_DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON

        AWS_PROFILE=acme-core-gbl-auto-admin

        set -e

        chamber write github_runners/docker config-json -- "$ENCODED_DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON"

        echo 'Saved Docker Config JSON to the AWS SSM Parameter Store'
```

Don't forget to update the AWS Profile in the script.

### Using Runner Groups

GitHub supports grouping runners into distinct
[Runner Groups](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups),
which allow you to have different access controls for different runners. Read the linked documentation about creating
and configuring Runner Groups, which you must do through the GitHub Web UI. If you choose to create Runner Groups, you
can assign one or more Runner pools (from the `runners` map) to groups (only one group per runner pool) by including
`group: <Runner Group Name>` in the runner configuration. We recommend including it immediately after `scope`.

### Using Webhook Driven Autoscaling (recommended)

We recommend using Webhook Driven Autoscaling until GitHub's own autoscaling solution is as capable as the Summerwind
solution this component deploys. See
[this discussion](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/discussions/3340) for some perspective on why the
Summerwind solution is currently (summer 2024) considered superior.

To use the Webhook Driven Autoscaling, in addition to setting `webhook_driven_scaling_enabled` to `true`, you must also
install the GitHub organization-level webhook after deploying the component (specifically, the webhook server). The URL
for the webhook is determined by the `webhook.hostname_template` and where it is deployed. Recommended URL is
`https://gha-webhook.[environment].[stage].[tenant].[service-discovery-domain]`.

As a GitHub organization admin, go to `https://github.com/organizations/[organization]/settings/hooks`, and then:

- Click"Add webhook" and create a new webhook with the following settings:
  - Payload URL: copy from Terraform output `webhook_payload_url`
  - Content type: `application/json`
  - Secret: whatever you configured in the `sops` secret above
  - Which events would you like to trigger this webhook:
    - Select "Let me select individual events"
    - Uncheck everything ("Pushes" is likely the only thing already selected)
    - Check "Workflow jobs"
  - Ensure that "Active" is checked (should be checked by default)
  - Click "Add webhook" at the bottom of the settings page

After the webhook is created, select "edit" for the webhook and go to the "Recent Deliveries" tab and verify that there
is a delivery (of a "ping" event) with a green check mark. If not, verify all the settings and consult the logs of the
`actions-runner-controller-github-webhook-server` pod.

### Configuring Webhook Driven Autoscaling

The `HorizontalRunnerAutoscaler scaleUpTriggers.duration` (see [Webhook Driven Scaling documentation](https://github.
com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/automatically-scaling-runners.md#webhook-driven-scaling)) is
controlled by the `max_duration` setting for each Runner. The purpose of this timeout is to ensure, in case a job
cancellation or termination event gets missed, that the resulting idle runner eventually gets terminated.

#### How the Autoscaler Determines the Desired Runner Pool Size

When a job is queued, a `capacityReservation` is created for it. The HRA (Horizontal Runner Autoscaler) sums up all the
capacity reservations to calculate the desired size of the runner pool, subject to the limits of `minReplicas` and
`maxReplicas`. The idea is that a `capacityReservation` is deleted when a job is completed or canceled, and the pool
size will be equal to `jobsStarted - jobsFinished`. However, it can happen that a job will finish without the HRA being
successfully notified about it, so as a safety measure, the `capacityReservation` will expire after a configurable
amount of time, at which point it will be deleted without regard to the job being finished. This ensures that eventually
an idle runner pool will scale down to `minReplicas`.

If it happens that the capacity reservation expires before the job is finished, the Horizontal Runner Autoscaler (HRA)
will scale down the pool by 2 instead of 1: once because the capacity reservation expired, and once because the job
finished. This will also cause starvation of waiting jobs, because the next in line will have its timeout timer started
but will not actually start running because no runner is available. And if `minReplicas` is set to zero, the pool will
scale down to zero before finishing all the jobs, leaving some waiting indefinitely. This is why it is important to set
the `max_duration` to a time long enough to cover the full time a job may have to wait between the time it is queued and
the time it finishes, assuming that the HRA scales up the pool by 1 and runs the job on the new runner.

:::info If there are more jobs queued than there are runners allowed by `maxReplicas`, the timeout timer does not start
on the capacity reservation until enough reservations ahead of it are removed for it to be considered as representing
and active job. Although there are some edge cases regarding `max_duration` that seem not to be covered properly (see
[actions-runner-controller issue #2466](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/issues/2466)), they only
merit adding a few extra minutes to the timeout.

:::

### Recommended `max_duration` Duration

#### Consequences of Too Short of a `max_duration` Duration

If you set `max_duration` to too short a duration, the Horizontal Runner Autoscaler will cancel capacity reservations
for jobs that have not yet finished, and the pool will become too small. This will be most serious if you have set
`minReplicas = 0` because in this case, jobs will be left in the queue indefinitely. With a higher value of
`minReplicas`, the pool will eventually make it through all the queued jobs, but not as quickly as intended due to the
incorrectly reduced capacity.

#### Consequences of Too Long of a `max_duration` Duration

If the Horizontal Runner Autoscaler misses a scale-down event (which can happen because events do not have delivery
guarantees), a runner may be left running idly for as long as the `max_duration` duration. The only problem with this is
the added expense of leaving the idle runner running.

#### Recommendation

As a result, we recommend setting `max_duration` to a period long enough to cover:

- The time it takes for the HRA to scale up the pool and make a new runner available
- The time it takes for the runner to pick up the job from GitHub
- The time it takes for the job to start running on the new runner
- The maximum time a job might take

Because the consequences of expiring a capacity reservation before the job is finished can be severe, we recommend
setting `max_duration` to a period at least 30 minutes longer than you expect the longest job to take. Remember, when
everything works properly, the HRA will scale down the pool as jobs finish, so there is little cost to setting a long
duration, and the cost looks even smaller by comparison to the cost of having too short a duration.

For lightly used runner pools expecting only short jobs, you can set `max_duration` to `"30m"`. As a rule of thumb, we
recommend setting `maxReplicas` high enough that jobs never wait on the queue more than an hour.

### Interaction with Karpenter or other EKS autoscaling solutions

Kubernetes cluster autoscaling solutions generally expect that a Pod runs a service that can be terminated on one Node
and restarted on another with only a short duration needed to finish processing any in-flight requests. When the cluster
is resized, the cluster autoscaler will do just that. However, GitHub Action Runner Jobs do not fit this model. If a Pod
is terminated in the middle of a job, the job is lost. The likelihood of this happening is increased by the fact that
the Action Runner Controller Autoscaler is expanding and contracting the size of the Runner Pool on a regular basis,
causing the cluster autoscaler to more frequently want to scale up or scale down the EKS cluster, and, consequently, to
move Pods around.

To handle these kinds of situations, Karpenter respects an annotation on the Pod:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt: "true"
```

When you set this annotation on the Pod, Karpenter will not evict it. This means that the Pod will stay on the Node it
is on, and the Node it is on will not be considered for eviction. This is good because it means that the Pod will not be
terminated in the middle of a job. However, it also means that the Node the Pod is on will not be considered for
termination, which means that the Node will not be removed from the cluster, which means that the cluster will not
shrink in size when you would like it to.

Since the Runner Pods terminate at the end of the job, this is not a problem for the Pods actually running jobs.
However, if you have set `minReplicas > 0`, then you have some Pods that are just idling, waiting for jobs to be
assigned to them. These Pods are exactly the kind of Pods you want terminated and moved when the cluster is
underutilized. Therefore, when you set `minReplicas > 0`, you should **NOT** set `karpenter.sh/do-not-evict: "true"` on
the Pod via the `pod_annotations` attribute of the `runners` input. (**But wait**, _there is good news_!)

We have [requested a feature](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/issues/2562) that will allow you to
set `karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt: "true"` and `minReplicas > 0` at the same time by only annotating Pods running jobs.
Meanwhile, **we have implemented this for you** using a job startup hook. This hook will set annotations on the Pod when
the job starts. When the job finishes, the Pod will be deleted by the controller, so the annotations will not need to be
removed. Configure annotations that apply only to Pods running jobs in the `running_pod_annotations` attribute of the
`runners` input.

### Updating CRDs

When updating the chart or application version of `actions-runner-controller`, it is possible you will need to install
new CRDs. Such a requirement should be indicated in the `actions-runner-controller` release notes and may require some
adjustment to our custom chart or configuration.

This component uses `helm` to manage the deployment, and `helm` will not auto-update CRDs. If new CRDs are needed,
install them manually via a command like

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller/master/charts/actions-runner-controller/crds/actions.summerwind.dev_horizontalrunnerautoscalers.yaml
```
