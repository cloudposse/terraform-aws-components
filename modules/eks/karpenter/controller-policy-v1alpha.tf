#####
# The primary and current (v1beta API) controller policy is in the controller-policy.tf file.
#
# However, if you have workloads that were deployed under the v1alpha API, you need to also
# apply this controller-policy-v1alpha.tf policy to the Karpenter controller to give it permission
# to manage (an in particular, delete) those workloads, and give it permission to manage the
# EC2 Instance Profile possibly created by the EKS cluster component.
#
# This policy is not needed for workloads deployed under the v1beta API with the
# EC2 Instance Profile created by the Karpenter controller.
#
# This allows it to terminate instances and delete launch templates that are tagged with the
# v1alpha API tag "karpenter.sh/provisioner-name" and to manage the EC2 Instance Profile
# created by the EKS cluster component.
#
# We create a separate policy and attach it separately to the Karpenter controller role
# because the main policy is near the 6,144 character limit for an IAM policy, and
# adding this to it can push it over. See:
#   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entities
