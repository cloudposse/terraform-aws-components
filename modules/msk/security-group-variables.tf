# Copy this file from https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-security-group/blob/master/exports/security-group-variables.tf
# and EDIT IT TO SUIT YOUR PROJECT. Update the version number above if you update this file from a later version.
# Unlike null-label context.tf, this file cannot be automatically updated

#
# This file provides the standard inputs that all Cloud Posse Open Source
# Terraform module that create AWS Security Groups should implement.
# This file does NOT provide implementation of the inputs, as that
# of course varies with each module.
#
# This file declares some standard outputs modules should create,
# but the declarations should be moved to `outputs.tf` and of course
# may need to be modified based on the module's use of security-group.

##
## allowed_* inputs are optional, because the same thing can be accomplished by
## providing `additional_security_group_rules`. However, if the rules this
## module creates are non-trivial (for example, opening ports based on
## feature settings, see https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-msk-apache-kafka-cluster/blob/3fe23c402cc420799ae721186812482335f78d24/main.tf#L14-L53 )
## then it makes sense to include these.
## Reasons not to include some or all of these inputs include
## - too hard to implement
## - does not make sense (particularly the IPv6 inputs if the underlying resource does not yet support IPv6)
## - likely to confuse users
## - likely to invite count/for_each issues

    replaced with the new one, eliminating any service interruption.
    When `true` or when changing the value (from `false` to `true` or from `true` to `false`),
    existing security group rules will be deleted before new ones are created, resulting in a service interruption,
    but preserving the security group itself.
    **NOTE:** Setting this to `true` does not guarantee the security group will never be replaced,
    it only keeps changes to the security group rules from triggering a replacement.

    A list of Security Group rule objects to add to the created security group, in addition to the ones
    this module normally creates. (To suppress the module's rules, set `create_security_group` to false
    and supply your own security group(s) via `associated_security_group_ids`.)
    The keys and values of the objects are fully compatible with the `aws_security_group_rule` resource, except
    for `security_group_id` which will be ignored, and the optional "key" which, if provided, must be unique and known at "plan" time.

#### We do not expose an `additional_security_group_rule_matrix` input for a few reasons:
# - It is a convenience and ultimately provides no rules that cannot be provided via `additional_security_group_rules`
# - It is complicated and can, in some situations, create problems for Terraform `for_each`
# - It is difficult to document and easy to make mistakes using it


#
#
#### The variables below (but not the outputs) can be omitted if not needed, and may need their descriptions modified

## Special note about inline_rules_enabled and revoke_rules_on_delete
##
## The security-group inputs inline_rules_enabled and revoke_rules_on_delete should not
## be exposed in other modules unless there is a strong reason for them to be used.
## We discourage the use of inline_rules_enabled and we rarely need or want
## revoke_rules_on_delete, so we do not want to clutter our interface with those inputs.
##
## If someone wants to enable either of those options, they have the option
## of creating a security group configured as they like
## and passing it in as the target security group.

variable "inline_rules_enabled" {

    See [#20046](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/20046) for one of several issues with inline rules.
    See [this post](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/9032#issuecomment-639545250) for details on the difference between inline rules and rule resources.
