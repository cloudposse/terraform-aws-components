### what

- Added a placeholder file for `docs/upgrade-guide.md` with a basic explanation of what is to come

### why

- With #811 we moved the contents of this upgrade-guide file to the individual component. We plan to continue adding
  upgrade guides for individual components, and in addition, create a higher-level upgrade guide here
- However, the build steps for refarch-scaffold expect `docs/upgrade-guide.md` to exist and are failing without it. We
  need a placeholder until the `account-map`, etc changes are added to this file

### references

  <summary>Datadog upgrades @Nuru (#814)</summary>

### what

- Update Datadog components:
  - `eks/datadog-agent` see `eks/datadog-agent/CHANGELOG.md`
  - `datadog-configuration` better handling of `enabled = false`
  - `datadog-integration` move "module count" back to "module" for better compatibility and maintainability, see
    `datadog-integration/CHANGELOG.md`
  - `datadog-lambda-forwared` fix issues around `enable = false` and incomplete destruction of resources (particularly
    log groups) see `datadog-lambda-forwarder/CHANGELOG.md`
  - Cleanup `datadog-monitor` see `datadog-monitor/CHANGELOG.md` for details. Possible breaking change in that several
    inputs have been removed, but they were previously ignored anyway, so no infrastructure change should result from
    you simply removing any inputs you had for the removed inputs.
  - Update `datadog-sythetics` dependency `remote-state` version
  - `datadog-synthetics-private-location` migrate control of namespace to `helm-release` module. Possible destruction
    and recreation of component on upgrade. See CHANGELOG.md

### why

- More reliable deployments, especially when destroying or disabling them
- Bug fixes and new features

- [eks/karpenter] use Instance Profile name from EKS output
- Clarify recommendation and fix defaults regarding deploying add-ons to managed node group

### why

### why

- Until now, we provisioned StorageClasses as a part of deploying
  [eks/ebs-controller](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/ba309ab4ffa96169b2b8dadce0643d13c1bd3ae9/modules/eks/ebs-controller/main.tf#L20-L56)
  and
  [eks/efs-controller](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/ba309ab4ffa96169b2b8dadce0643d13c1bd3ae9/modules/eks/efs-controller/main.tf#L48-L60).
  However, with the switch from deploying "self-managed" controllers to EKS add-ons, we no longer deploy
  `eks/ebs-controller` or `eks/efs-controller`. Therefore, we need a new component to manage StorageClasses
  independently of controllers.

  <summary>[eks/karpenter] Script to update Karpenter CRDs @Nuru (#793)</summary>

### what

- [eks/karpenter] Script to update Karpenter CRDs

### why

- Upgrading Karpenter to v0.28.0 requires updating CRDs, which is not handled by current Helm chart. This script updates
  them by modifying the existing CRDs to be labeled as being managed by Helm, then installing the `karpenter-crd` Helm
  chart.

### what

- Added new variable into `argocd-repo` component to configure ArcoCD `ignore-differences`

### why

- There are cases when application and/or third-party operators might want to change k8s API objects. For example,
  change the number of replicas in deployment. This will conflict with ArgoCD application because the ArgoCD controller
  will spot drift and will try to make an application in sync with the codebase.

  <summary>[aws-teams] Remove obsolete restriction on assuming roles in identity account @Nuru (#761)</summary>

### what

- [aws-teams] Remove obsolete restriction on assuming roles in the `identity` account

### why

Some time ago, there was an implied permission for any IAM role to assume any other IAM role in the same account if the
originating role had sufficient permissions to perform `sts:AssumeRole`. For this reason, we had an explicit policy
against assuming roles in the `identity` account.

AWS has removed that implied permission and now requires all roles to have explicit trust policies. Our current Team
structure requires Teams (e.g. `spacelift`) to be able to assume roles in `identity` (e.g. `planner`). Therefore, the
previous restriction is both not needed and actually hinders desired operation.

  <summary>Add EKS addons and the required IRSA to the `eks` component @aknysh (#723)</summary>

### what

- Deprecate the `eks-iam` component
- Add EKS addons and the required IRSA for the addons to the `eks` component
- Add ability to specify configuration values and timeouts for addons
- Add ability to deploy addons to Fargate when necessary
- Add ability to omit specifying Availability Zones and infer them from private subnets
- Add recommended but optional and requiring opt-in: use a single Fargate Pod Execution Role for all Fargate Profiles

### why

- The `eks-iam` component is not in use (we now create the IAM roles for Kubernetes Service Accounts in the
  https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-helm-release module), and has very old and outdated code

- AWS recommends to provision the required EKS addons and not to rely on the managed addons (some of which are
  automatically provisioned by EKS on a cluster)

- Some EKS addons (e.g. `vpc-cni` and `aws-ebs-csi-driver`) require an IAM Role for Kubernetes Service Account (IRSA)
  with specific permissions. Since these addons are critical for cluster functionality, we create the IRSA roles for the
  addons in the `eks` component and provide the role ARNs to the addons

- Some EKS addons can be configured. In particular, `coredns` requires configuration to enable it to be deployed to
  Fargate.

- Users relying on Karpenter to deploy all nodes and wanting to deploy `coredns` or `aws-ebs-csi-driver` addons need to
  deploy them to Fargate or else the EKS deployment will fail.

- Enable DRY specification of Availability Zones, and use of AZ IDs, by reading the VPCs AZs.

- A cluster needs only one Fargate Pod Execution Role, and it was a mistake to provision one for every profile. However,
  making the change would break existing clusters, so it is optional and requires opt-in.

- Restore backwards compatibility of `account-map` output

### why

- PR #715 removed outputs from `account-map` that `iam-roles` relied on. Although it removed the references in
  `iam-roles`, this imposed an ordering on the upgrade: the `iam-roles` code had to be deployed before the module could
  be applied. That proved to be inconvenient. Furthermore, if a future `account-map` upgrade added outputs that
  iam-roles`required, neither order of operations would go smoothly. With this update, the standard practice of applying`account-map`
  before deploying code will work again.

### Upgrade notes:

There is a bug in this version of `github-oidc-provider`. Upgrade to version v1.240.1 or later instead.

After installing this version of `github-oidc-provider`, you may need to change the configuration in your stacks.

- If you have dynamic Terraform roles enabled, then this should be configured like a normal component. The previous
  component may have required you to set

      ```yaml
      backend:
        s3:
          role_arn: null
      ````

  and **that configuration should be removed** everywhere.

- If you only use SuperAdmin to deploy things to the `identity` account, then for the `identity` (and `root`, if
  applicable) account **_only_**, set

      ```yaml
      backend:
        s3:
          role_arn: null
      vars:
        superadmin: true
      ````

  **Deployments to other accounts should not have any of those settings**.

  <summary>IAM upgrades: SSO Permission Sets as Teams, SourceIdentity support, region independence @Nuru (#738)</summary>

### what

- Enable SSO Permission Sets to function as teams
- Allow SAML sign on via any regional endpoint, not only us-east-1
- Allow use of AWS "Source Identity" for SAML and SSO users (not enabled for OIDC)

### why

- Reduce the friction between SSO permission sets and SAML roles by allowing people to use either interchangeably.
  (Almost. SSO permission sets do not yet have the same permissions as SAML roles in the `identity` account itself.)
- Enable continued access in the event of a regional outage in us-east-1 as happened recently
- Enable auditing of who is using assumed roles

The regional endpoints and Source Identity support are non-controversial and cannot be disabled. They do, however,
require running `terraform apply` against `aws-saml`, `aws-teams`, and `aws-team-roles` in all accounts.

#### AWS SSO updates

To enable SSO Permission Sets to function as teams, you need to update `account-map` and `aws-sso`, then apply changes
to

- `tfstate-backend`
- `aws-teams`
- `aws-team-roles`
- `aws-sso`

This is all enabled by default. If you do not want it, you only need to update `account-map`, and add
`account-map/modules/roles-to-principles/variables_override.tf` in which you set
`overridable_team_permission_sets_enabled` to default to `false`

Under the old `iam-primary-roles` component, corresponding permission sets were named `Identity<role>RoleAccess`. Under
the current `aws-teams` component, they are named `Identity<role>TeamAccess`. The current `account-map` defaults to the
latter convention. To use the earlier convention, add `account-map/modules/roles-to-principles/variables_override.tf` in
which you set `overridable_team_permission_set_name_pattern` to default to `"Identity%sRoleAccess"`

There is a chance the resulting trust policies will be too big, especially for `tfstate-backend`. If you get an error
like

```
Cannot exceed quota for ACLSizePerRole: 2048
```

You need to request a quota increase (Quota Code L-C07B4B0D), which will be automatically granted, usually in about 5
minutes. The max quota is 4096, but we recommend increasing it to 3072 first, so you retain some breathing room for the
future.

### what

- include both thumbprints for GitHub OIDC

### why

- There are two possible intermediary certificates for the Actions SSL certificate and either can be returned by
  Github's servers, requiring customers to trust both. This is a known behavior when the intermediary certificates are
  cross-signed by the CA.

  <summary>[account-map]  Backwards compatibility for terraform profile users and eks/cluster  @Nuru (#731)</summary>

### what

- [account-map/modules/iam-roles] Add `profiles_enabled` input to override global value
- [eks/cluster] Use `iam-roles` `profiles_enabled` input to force getting a role ARN even when profiles are in use
- [guardduty] Make providers compatible with static and dynamic TF roles

### why

- Previously, when the global `account-map` `profiles_enabled` flag was `true`, `iam_roles.terraform_role_arn` would be
  null. However, `eks/cluster` requires `terraform_role_arn` regardless.
- Changes made in #728 work in environments that have not adopted dynamic Terraform roles but would fail in environments
  that have (when using SuperAdmin)

  <summary>[account-map] Feature flag to enable legacy Terraform role mapping @Nuru (#730)</summary>

### what

- [account-map] Add `legacy_terraform_uses_admin` feature flag to retain backwards compatibility

### why

- Historically, the `terraform` roles in `root` and `identity` were not used for Terraform plan/apply, but for other
  things, and so the `terraform_roles` map output selected the `admin` roles for those accounts. This "wart" has been
  remove in current `aws-team-roles` and `tfstate-backend` configurations, but for people who do not want to migrate to
  the new conventions, this feature flag enables them to maintain the status quo with respect to role usage while taking
  advantage of other updates to `account-map` and other components.

### references

This update is recommended for all customers wanting to use **_any_** component version 1.227 or later.

<details>
  <summary>[lambda] feat: allows to use YAML instead of JSON for IAM policy @gberenice (#692)</summary>

### what

- BREAKING CHANGE: Actually use variable `function_name` to set the lambda function name.
- Make the variable `function_name` optional. When not set, the old null-lable-derived name will be use.
- Allow IAM policy to be specified in a custom terraform object as an alternative to JSON.

### why

- `function_name` was required to set, but it wasn't actually passed to `module "lambda"` inputs.
- Allow callers to stop providing `function_name` and preserve old behavior of using automatically generated name.
- When using [Atmos](https://atmos.tools/) to generate inputs from "stack" YAML files, having the ability to pass the
  statements in as a custom object means specifying them via YAML, which makes the policy declaration in stack more
  readable compared to embedding a JSON string in the YAML.

</details>

## 1.227.0 (2023-06-12T23:41:45Z)

Possibly breaking change:

In this update, `account-map/modules/iam-roles` acquired a provider, making it no longer able to be used with `count`.
If you have code like

```hcl
module "optional_role" {
  count = local.optional_role_enabled ? 1 : 0

  source  = "../account-map/modules/iam-roles"
  stage   = var.optional_role_stage
  context = module.this.context
}
```

You will need to rewrite it, removing the `count` parameter. It will be fine to always instantiate the module. If there
are problems with ensuring appropriate settings with the module is disabled, you can always replace them with the
component's inputs:

```hcl
module "optional_role" {
  source  = "../account-map/modules/iam-roles"
  stage   = local.optional_role_enabled ? var.optional_role_stage : var.stage
  context = module.this.context
}
```

The update to components 1.227.0 is huge, and you have options.

- Enable, or not, dynamic Terraform IAM roles, which allow you to give some people (and Spacelift) the ability to run
  Terraform plan in some accounts without allowing apply. Note that these users will still have read/write access to
  Terraform state, but will not have IAM permissions to make changes in accounts.
  [terraform_dynamic_role_enabled](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/1b338fe664e5debc5bbac30cfe42003f7458575a/modules/account-map/variables.tf#L96-L100)
- Update to new `aws-teams` team names. The new names are (except for support) distinct from team-roles, making it
  easier to keep track. Also, the new managers team can run Terraform for identity and root in most (but not all) cases.
- Update to new `aws-team-roles`, including new permissions. The custom policies that have been removed are replaced in
  the `aws-team-roles` configuration with AWS managed policy ARNs. This is required to add the `planner` role and
  support the `terraform plan` restriction.
- Update the `providers.tf for` all components. Or some of them now, some later. Most components do not require updates,
  but all of them have updates. The new `providers.tf`, when used with dynamic Terraform roles, allows users directly
  logged into target accounts (rather than having roles in the `identity` account) to use Terraform in that account, and
  also allows SuperAdmin to run Terraform in more cases (almost everywhere).

**If you do not want any new features**, you only need to update `account-map` to v1.235 or later, to be compatible with
future components. Note that when updating `account-map` this way, you should update the code everywhere (all open PRs
and branches) before applying the Terraform changes, because the applied changes break the old code.

If you want all the new features, we recommend updating all of the following to the current release in 1 PR:

- account-map
- aws-teams
- aws-team-roles
- tfstate-backend

<details>
  <summary>Enable `terraform plan` access via dynamic Terraform roles @Nuru (#715)</summary>

### Reviewers, please note:

The PR changes a lot of files. In particular, the `providers.tf` and therefore the `README.md` for nearly every
component. Therefore it will likely be easier to review this PR one commit at a time.

`import_role_arn` and `import_profile_name` have been removed as they are no longer needed. Current versions of
Terraform (probably beginning with v1.1.0, but maybe as late as 1.3.0, I have not found authoritative information) can
read data sources during plan and so no longer need a role to be explicitly specified while importing. Feel free to
perform your own tests to make yourself more comfortable that this is correct.

### what

- Updates to allow Terraform to dynamically assume a role based on the user, to allow some users to run `terraform plan`
  but not `terraform apply`
  - Deploy standard `providers.tf` to all components that need an `aws` provider
  - Move extra provider configurations to separate file, so that `providers.tf` can remain consistent/identical among
    components and thus be easily updated
  - Create `provider-awsutils.mixin.tf` to provide consistent, maintainable implementation
- Make `aws-sso` vendor safe
- Deprecate `sso` module in favor of `aws-saml`

### why

- Allow users to try new code or updated configurations by running `terraform plan` without giving them permission to
  make changes with Terraform
- Make it easier for people directly logged into target accounts to still run Terraform
- Follow-up to #697, which updated `aws-teams` and `aws-team-roles`, to make `aws-sso` consistent
- Reduce confusion by moving deprecated code to `deprecated/`

### Why

Google is one of those identity providers that doesn't have good integration with AWS SSO. In order to sync groups and
users across we need to use some API calls, luckily AWS Built [aws-ssosync](https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync) to
handle that.

Unfortunately, it required ASM so we use [Benbentwo/ssosync](https://github.com/Benbentwo/ssosync) as it removes that
requirement.

### what

- Set `helm_manifest_experiment_enabled` to `false` by default
- Block Kubernetes provider 2.21.0

### why

- The `helm_manifest_experiment_enabled` reliably breaks when a Helm chart installs CRDs. The initial reason for

  <summary>Introducing GuardDuty @zdmytriv (#682)</summary>

### what

- Introducing GuardDuty component

### why

AWS GuardDuty is a managed threat detection service. It is designed to help protect AWS accounts and workloads by
continuously monitoring for malicious activities and unauthorized behaviors. GuardDuty analyzes various data sources
within your AWS environment, such as AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs, to detect potential security
threats.

Key features and components of AWS GuardDuty include:

- Threat detection: GuardDuty employs machine learning algorithms, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence
  to identify suspicious activities, unauthorized access attempts, and potential security threats. It analyzes event
  logs and network traffic data to detect patterns, anomalies, and known attack techniques.

- Threat intelligence: GuardDuty leverages threat intelligence feeds from AWS, trusted partners, and the global
  community to enhance its detection capabilities. It uses this intelligence to identify known malicious IP addresses,
  domains, and other indicators of compromise.

- Real-time alerts: When GuardDuty identifies a potential security issue, it generates real-time alerts that can be
  delivered through AWS CloudWatch Events. These alerts can be integrated with other AWS services like Amazon SNS or AWS
  Lambda for immediate action or custom response workflows.

- Multi-account support: GuardDuty can be enabled across multiple AWS accounts, allowing centralized management and
  monitoring of security across an entire organization's AWS infrastructure. This helps to maintain consistent security
  policies and practices.

- Automated remediation: GuardDuty integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS Macie, AWS Security Hub, and AWS
  Systems Manager, to facilitate automated threat response and remediation actions. This helps to minimize the impact of
  security incidents and reduces the need for manual intervention.

- Security findings and reports: GuardDuty provides detailed security findings and reports that include information
  about detected threats, affected AWS resources, and recommended remediation actions. These findings can be accessed
  through the AWS Management Console or retrieved via APIs for further analysis and reporting.

GuardDuty offers a scalable and flexible approach to threat detection within AWS environments, providing organizations
with an additional layer of security to proactively identify and respond to potential security risks.

  <summary>Upstream `aws-inspector` @milldr (#700)</summary>

### what

Upstream `aws-inspector` from past engagement

### why

- This component was never upstreamed and now were want to use it again
- AWS Inspector is a security assessment service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It helps you analyze and evaluate
  the security and compliance of your applications and infrastructure deployed on AWS. AWS Inspector automatically
  assesses the resources within your AWS environment, such as Amazon EC2 instances, for potential security
  vulnerabilities and deviations from security best practices. Here are some key features and functionalities of AWS
  Inspector:

  - Security Assessments: AWS Inspector performs security assessments by analyzing the behavior of your resources and
    identifying potential security vulnerabilities. It examines the network configuration, operating system settings,
    and installed software to detect common security issues.

  - Vulnerability Detection: AWS Inspector uses a predefined set of rules to identify common vulnerabilities,
    misconfigurations, and security exposures. It leverages industry-standard security best practices and continuously
    updates its knowledge base to stay current with emerging threats.

  - Agent-Based Architecture: AWS Inspector utilizes an agent-based approach, where you install an Inspector agent on
    your EC2 instances. The agent collects data about the system and its configuration, securely sends it to AWS
    Inspector, and allows for more accurate and detailed assessments.

  - Security Findings: After performing an assessment, AWS Inspector generates detailed findings that highlight security
    vulnerabilities, including their severity level, impact, and remediation steps. These findings can help you
    prioritize and address security issues within your AWS environment.

  - Integration with AWS Services: AWS Inspector seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS
    CloudFormation, AWS Systems Manager, and AWS Security Hub. This allows you to automate security assessments, manage
    findings, and centralize security information across your AWS infrastructure.

  <summary>Update `vpc` and `eks/cluster` components @aknysh (#677)</summary>

### what

- Update `vpc` and `eks/cluster` components

### why

- Use latest module versions

- Take into account `var.availability_zones` for the EKS cluster itself. Only the `node-group` module was using
  `var.availability_zones` to use the subnets from the provided AZs. The EKS cluster (control plane) was using all the
  subnets provisioned in a VPC. This caused issues because EKS is not available in all AZs in a region, e.g. it's not
  available in `us-east-1e` b/c of a limited capacity, and when using all AZs from `us-east-1`, the deployment fails

- The latest version of the `vpc` component (which was updated in this PR as well) has the outputs to get a map of AZs
  to the subnet IDs in each AZ

```
  # Get only the public subnets that correspond to the AZs provided in `var.availability_zones`
  # `az_public_subnets_map` is a map of AZ names to list of public subnet IDs in the AZs
  public_subnet_ids = flatten([for k, v in local.vpc_outputs.az_public_subnets_map : v if contains(var.availability_zones, k)])

  # Get only the private subnets that correspond to the AZs provided in `var.availability_zones`
  # `az_private_subnets_map` is a map of AZ names to list of private subnet IDs in the AZs
  private_subnet_ids = flatten([for k, v in local.vpc_outputs.az_private_subnets_map : v if contains(var.availability_zones, k)])
```

### why

- account-map remote state was missing from the `cloudtrail` component

- Session Name automatically logged in `user.extra.sessionName.0` starting at Kubernetes 1.20, plus addition had a typo

- Include session name in audit trail of users accessing EKS

### why

  of account names
- There is no reason to allow `root` users to access EKS clusters, so even when this code worked it was wrong

### what

- Upgraded `aws-sso` to use `0.7.1` modules
- Updated `account-map/modules/roles-to-principals` to support assume role from SSO users in the identity account
- Adjusted `aws-sso/policy-Identity-role-RoleAccess.tf` to use the identity account name vs the stage so it supports
  names like `core-identity` instead of just `identity`

### why

- `aws-sso` users could not assume role to plan/apply terraform locally
- using `core-identity` as a name broke the `aws-sso` policy since account `identity` does not exist in
  `full_account_map`

<details>
  <summary>Support setting consolidation in karpenter-provisioner @max-lobur (#536)</summary>

### what

This is an alternative way of deprovisioning - proactive one.

```
There is another way to configure Karpenter to deprovision nodes called Consolidation.
This mode is preferred for workloads such as microservices and is incompatible with setting
up the ttlSecondsAfterEmpty . When set in consolidation mode Karpenter works to actively
reduce cluster cost by identifying when nodes can be removed as their workloads will run
on other nodes in the cluster and when nodes can be replaced with cheaper variants due
to a change in the workloads
```

### why

- To let users set a more aggressive deprovisioning strategy

  <summary>Add account-quotas component @Nuru (#515)</summary>

### what

- Add `account-quotas` component to manage account service quota increase requests

### why

- Add service quotas to the infrastructure that can be represented in code

### notes

Cloud Posse has a [service quotas module](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-service-quotas), but it has
issues, such as not allowing the service to be specified by name, and not having well documented inputs. It also takes a
list input, but Atmos does not merge lists, so a map input is more appropriate. Overall I like this component better,
and if others do, too, I will replace the existing module (only at version 0.1.0) with this code.

## 1.86.0 (2022-10-19T07:28:11Z)

<details>
  <summary>Update EKS basic components @Nuru (#509)</summary>

### what && why

Update EKS cluster and basic Kubernetes components for better behavior on initial deployment and on `terraform destroy`.

- Update minimum Terraform version to 1.1.0 and use `one()` where applicable to manage resources that can be disabled
  with `count = 0` and for bug fixes regarding destroy behavior
- Update `terraform-aws-eks-cluster` to v2.5.0 for better destroy behavior
- Update all components' (plus `account-map/modules/`)`remote-state` to v1.2.0 for better destroy behavior
- Update all components' `helm-release` to v0.7.0 and move namespace creation via Kubernetes provider into it to avoid
  race conditions regarding creating IAM roles, Namespaces, and deployments, and to delete namespaces when destroyed
- Update `alb-controller` to deploy a default IngressClass for central, obvious configuration of shared default ingress
  for services that do not have special needs.
- Add `alb-controller-ingress-class` for the rare case when we want to deploy a non-default IngressClass outside of the
  component that will be using it
- Update `echo-server` to use the default IngressClass and not specify any configuration that affects other Ingresses,
  and remove dependence on `alb-controller-ingress-group` (which should be deprecated in favor of
  `alb-controller-ingress-class` and perhaps a specialized future `alb-controller-ingress`)
- Update `cert-manager` to remove `default.auto.tfvars` (which had a lot of settings) and add dependencies so that
  initial deployment succeeds in one `terraform apply` and destroy works in one `terraform destroy`
- Update `external-dns` to remove `default.auto.tfvars` (which had a lot of settings)
- Update `karpenter` to v0.18.0, fix/update IAM policy (README still needs work, but leaving that for another day)
- Update `karpenter-provisioner` to require Terraform 1.3 and make elements of the Provisioner configuration optional.
  Support block device mappings (previously broken). Avoid perpetual Terraform plan diff/drift caused by setting fields
  to `null`.
- Update `reloader`
- Update `mixins/provider-helm` to better support `terraform destroy` and to default the Kubernetes client
  authentication API version to `client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1`

## 1.84.0 (2022-10-12T22:49:28Z)

  <summary>Fix feature allowing IAM users to assume team roles @Nuru (#507)</summary>

### what

- Replace `deny_all_iam_users` input with `iam_users_enabled`
- Fix implementation
- Provide more context for `bats` test failures

### why

- Cloud Posse style guide dictates that boolean feature flags have names ending with `_enabled`
- Previous implementation only removed 1 of 2 policy provisions that blocked IAM users from assuming a role, and
  therefore IAM users were still not allowed to assume a role. Since the previous implementation did not work, a
  breaking change (changing the variable name) does not need major warnings or a major version bump.
- Indication of what was being tested was too far removed from `bats` test failure message to be able to easily identify
  what module had failed

### notes

Currently, any component provisioned by SuperAdmin needs to have a special provider configuration that requires
SuperAdmin to provision the component. This feature is part of what is needed to enable SuperAdmin (an IAM User) to work
with "normal" provider configurations.

### references

- Breaks change introduced in #495, but that didn't work anyway.
