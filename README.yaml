# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This is a collection of reusable Terraform components and blueprints for provisioning reference architectures.

introduction: |-
  In this repo you'll find real-world examples of how we've implemented various common patterns using our [terraform modules](https://cpco.io/terraform-modules) for our customers.

  The component catalog captures the business logic, opinions, best practices and non-functional requirements.

  It's from this catalog that other developers in your organization will pick and choose from anytime they need to deploy some new capability.

  These components make a lot of assumptions about how we've configured our environments. That said, they can still serve as an excellent reference for others.

  ## Deprecations

  Terraform components which are no longer actively maintained are now in the `deprecated/` folder.

  Many of these deprecated components are used in our old reference architectures.

  We intend to eventually delete, but are leaving them for now in the repo.

  ## Using `pre-commit` Hooks

  This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) to enforce consistent Terraform code and documentation. This is accomplished by triggering hooks during `git commit` to block commits that don't pass checks (E.g. format, and module documentation). You can find the hooks that are being executed in the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.

  You can install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and this repo's pre-commit hooks on a Mac machine by running the following commands:

  ```bash
  brew install pre-commit gawk terraform-docs coreutils
  pre-commit install --install-hooks
  ```

  Then run the following command to rebuild the docs for all Terraform components:

  ```bash
  make rebuild-docs
  ```
