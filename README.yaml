# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This is a collection of reusable Terraform components and blueprints for provisioning reference architectures.


introduction: |-
  In this repo you'll find real-world examples of how we've implemented various common patterns using our [terraform modules](https://cpco.io/terraform-modules) for our customers.

  The component catalog captures the business logic, opinions, best practices and non-functional requirements.

  It's from this catalog that other developers in your organization will pick and choose from anytime they need to deploy some new capability.

  These components make a lot of assumptions about how we've configured our environments. That said, they can still serve as an excellent reference for others.

  ## Deprecations

  Terraform components which are no longer actively maintained are now in the `deprecated/` folder.

  Many of these deprecated components are used in our old reference architectures.

  We intend to eventually delete, but are leaving them for now in the repo.
