      <description>The 12-Factor pattern is a language agnostic, “Best Practice” for writing Cloud Native applications that can be easily and consistently deployed using Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (“CI/CD”).
The pattern can be summed up as:
 (a) treat all apps as disposable services that receive their configuration via environment variables; (b) rely on backing services to provide durability; (c) script all changes; and (d) treat all environments (dev, prod, qa, etc) as identical.</description>
