This presence of a .github/.github-update-disabled file
prevents `make github/update` from making any changes including
changes to the CODEOWNERS file. You can prevent changes to
CODEOWNERS while allowing all other normal `github/update` changes
by creating a .github/.github-CODEOWNERS-update-disabled file instead.
The contents of these files are ignored, only their presence or absence matters.
