## NOTE
* If you are adding a new component to `terraform-aws-compoonents`, you must add a label to the pull request specifying the earliest major and minor versions of Terraform for which the component must remain backwards compatible. (E.g., `terraform/1.0` or `terraform/0.13`, etc.) This is the version of Terraform with which formatting tests will be run against your pull request.
