This is a collection of reusable [AWS Terraform components](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/) for provisioning infrastructure used by the Cloud Posse [reference architectures](https://cloudposse.com).
They work really well with [Atmos](https://atmos.tools), our open-source tool for managing infrastructure as code with Terraform.

## Introduction

In this repo you'll find real-world examples of how we've implemented various common patterns using our [terraform modules](https://cpco.io/terraform-modules) for our customers.

The [component library](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/) captures the business logic, opinions, best practices and non-functional requirements.

It's from this library that other developers in your organization will pick and choose from anytime they need to deploy some new capability.

These components make a lot of assumptions about how we've configured our environments. That said, they can still serve as an excellent reference for others.



## Usage




Please take a look at each [component's README](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/) for specific usage.

> [!TIP]
> ## 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> These components work really well with [Atmos](https://atmos.tools), our open-source tool for managing infrastructure as code with Terraform.

> *Example of running <a href="https://atmos.tools">`atmos`</a> to describe infrastructure.*
> </detalis>

Generally, you can use these components in [Atmos](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/) by adding the following code into your [stack manifest](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/stacks/):

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    <component_name>:
      vars:
        # Terraform variables
        # <var_name>: <var_value>

```


## Automated Updates of Components using GitHub Actions

Leverage the Atmos components GitHub Action to automate the creation and management of pull requests for component updates.

This is done by creating a new file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

The file should contain the following:

```yaml
jobs:
update:
  runs-on:
    - "ubuntu-latest"
  steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 1

    - name: Update Atmos Components
      uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-component-updater@v2
      env:
        # https://atmos.tools/cli/configuration/#environment-variables
        ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
      with:
        github-access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        log-level: INFO
        max-number-of-prs: 10

    - name: Delete abandoned update branches
      uses: phpdocker-io/github-actions-delete-abandoned-branches@v2
      with:
        github_token: ${{ github.token }}
        last_commit_age_days: 0
        allowed_prefixes: "component-update/"
        dry_run: no
```

For the full documentation on how to use the Component Updater GitHub Action, please see the [Atmos Intergations](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/component-updater) documentation.

## Using `pre-commit` Hooks

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) to enforce consistent Terraform code and documentation. This is accomplished by triggering hooks during `git commit` to block commits that don't pass checks (E.g. format, and module documentation). You can find the hooks that are being executed in the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.

You can install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and this repo's pre-commit hooks on a Mac machine by running the following commands:

```bash
brew install pre-commit gawk terraform-docs coreutils
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Then run the following command to rebuild the docs for all Terraform components:

```bash
make rebuild-docs
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Deprecated Components
> Terraform components which are no longer actively maintained are kept in the [`deprecated/`](deprecated/) folder.
>
> Many of these deprecated components are used in our older reference architectures.
>
> We intend to eventually delete, but are leaving them for now in the repo.
