This is a collection of reusable [Terraform root modules invocations](https://docs.cloudposse.com/terraform-modules/root/) for CloudPosse AWS accounts.

Terraform defines a "root module" as the current working directory holding the Terraform configuration files where the terraform apply or terraform get is run.
