This is a collection of reusable [AWS Terraform components](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/) for provisioning infrastructure used by the Cloud Posse [reference architectures](https://cloudposse.com).
They work really well with [Atmos](https://atmos.tools), our open-source tool for managing infrastructure as code with Terraform.

## Introduction

In this repo you'll find real-world examples of how we've implemented Terraform "root" modules as native
[Atmos Components](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/) for our customers. These Components
leverage our hundreds of free and open-source [terraform "child" modules](https://cpco.io/terraform-modules).

The [component library](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/) captures the business logic, opinions, best practices and
non-functional requirements for an organization.

It's from this library that other developers in your organization will pick and choose from whenever they need to deploy some new
capability.

These components make a lot of assumptions (aka ["convention over configuration"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)) about how we've configured our environments.
That said, they still serve as an excellent reference for others on how to build, organize and distribute enterprise-grade infrastructure
with Terraform that can be used with [Atmos](https://atmos.tools).




## Usage


Please take a look at each [component's README](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/) for specific usage.

> [!TIP]
> ## 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> To orchestrate multiple environments with ease using Terraform, Cloud Posse recommends using [Atmos](https://atmos.tools),
> our open-source tool for Terraform automation.

> </detalis>

Generally, you can use these components in [Atmos](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/) by adding something like the following
code into your [stack manifest](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/stacks/):

```yaml
components:                      # List of components to include in the stack
  terraform:                     # The toolchain being used for configuration
    vpc:                         # The name of the component (e.g. terraform "root" module)
      vars:                      # Terraform variables (e.g. `.tfvars`)
        cidr_block: 10.0.0.0/16  # A variable input passed to terraform via `.tfvars`
```

## Automated Updates of Components using GitHub Actions

Leverage our [GitHub Action](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/component-updater) to automate the creation and management of pull requests for component updates.

This is done by creating a new file (e.g. `atmos-component-updater.yml`) in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

The file should contain the following:

```yaml
jobs:
update:
  runs-on:
    - "ubuntu-latest"
  steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 1

    - name: Update Atmos Components
      uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-component-updater@v2
      env:
        # https://atmos.tools/cli/configuration/#environment-variables
        ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
      with:
        github-access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        log-level: INFO
        max-number-of-prs: 10

    - name: Delete abandoned update branches
      uses: phpdocker-io/github-actions-delete-abandoned-branches@v2
      with:
        github_token: ${{ github.token }}
        last_commit_age_days: 0
        allowed_prefixes: "component-update/"
        dry_run: no
```

For the full documentation on how to use the Component Updater GitHub Action, please see the [Atmos Intergations](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/component-updater) documentation.

## Using `pre-commit` Hooks

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) to enforce consistent Terraform code and documentation. This is accomplished by triggering hooks during `git commit` to block commits that don't pass checks (E.g. format, and module documentation). You can find the hooks that are being executed in the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.

You can install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and this repo's pre-commit hooks on a Mac machine by running the following commands:

```bash
brew install pre-commit gawk terraform-docs coreutils
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Then run the following command to rebuild the docs for all Terraform components:

```bash
make rebuild-docs
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Deprecated Components
> Terraform components which are no longer actively maintained are kept in the [`deprecated/`](deprecated/) folder.
>
> Many of these deprecated components are used in our older reference architectures.
>
> We intend to eventually delete, but are leaving them for now in the repo.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
