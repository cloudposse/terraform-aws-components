This is a collection of reusable [Terraform "root modules" invocations](https://docs.cloudposse.com/terraform-modules/root/) for CloudPosse AWS accounts.

Terraform defines a "root module" as the current working directory holding the Terraform configuration files where the terraform apply or terraform get is run.

## Introduction

In this repo you'll find real-world examples of how we've implemented various common patterns using our [terraform modules](https://cpco.io/terraform-modules) for our customers. 

The "root modules" form the module catalog of your organization. It's from this catalog that other developers in your organization will pick and choose from anytime they need to deploy some new capability.

Normally, a company should build up their own service catalog of terraform modules like this one, which is just a collection of terraform modules that capture the business logic, opinions, "best practices" and non-functional requirements of the organization.
No two companies will ever have the same assembly of `terraform-root-modules`.

The root modules are the most opinionated incarnations of modules that seldom translate verbatim across organizations. This is your secret sauce. We could never implement this in a sufficiently generic way without creating crazy bloat and complexity. Therefore treat the terraform-root-modules in this repository as your “starting off point” where you hardfork/diverge. 
These modules are very specific to how we do things in our environment, so they might not "drop in" smoothly in other environments as they make a lot of assumptions on how things are organized.

A company writes their own root modules. It’s their flavor of how to leverage the [generic building blocks](https://cpco.io/terraform-modules) to achieve the specific customizations that are required without needing to write everything from the ground up because they are leveraging our general purpose modules.
The idea is to write all of the [`terraform-aws-*`](https://cpco.io/terraform-modules) type modules very generically so they are easily composable inside of other modules.

These `terraform-root-modules` make a lot of assumptions about how we've configured our environments. That said, they can still serve as an excellent reference for others.

We recommend that you start with your clean `terraform-root-module` repo. Then start by creating a new project in there to describe the infrastructure that you want.

## Best Practices

* Every "root module" should include a `Makefile` that defines `init`, `plan`, and `apply` targets. 
  This establishes a common interface for interacting with terraform without the need of a wrapper like `terragrunt`.
* Never compose "root modules" inside of other root modules. If or when this is desired, then the module should be split off into a new repository and versioned independently as a standalone module.

## Example Makefile

Here's a good example of a `Makefile` for a terraform project:

```
-include Makefile.*

## Initialize terraform remote state
init:
	[ -f .terraform/terraform.tfstate ] || terraform $@

## Clean up the project
clean:
	rm -rf .terraform *.tfstate*

## Pass arguments through to terraform which require remote state
apply console destroy graph plan output providers show: init
	terraform $@

## Pass arguments through to terraform which do not require remote state
get fmt validate version:
	terraform $@
```

## Usage

Use the `terraform-root-modules` Docker image as the base image in the application `Dockerfile`, and copy the modules from `/aws` folder into `/conf` folder.

```dockerfile
FROM cloudposse/terraform-root-modules:0.3.2 as terraform-root-modules

FROM cloudposse/geodesic:0.9.18

# Copy root modules into /conf folder
COPY --from=terraform-root-modules /aws/ /conf/

WORKDIR /conf/
```




## Examples

For example usage, refer to the "Related Projects" section. This is were we use `terraform-root-modules` to provision essential account-level infrastructure, among other services.



## Makefile Targets
```
Available targets:

  help                                Help screen
  help/all                            Display help for all targets
  help/short                          This help short screen

```
