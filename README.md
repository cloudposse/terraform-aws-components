This is a collection of reusable Terraform components for provisioning infrastructure used by the Cloud Posse [reference architectures](https://cloudposse.com).

---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) approach towards DevOps.


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).












## Introduction

In this repo you'll find real-world examples of how we've implemented various common patterns using our [terraform modules](https://cpco.io/terraform-modules) for our customers.

The [component library](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/) captures the business logic, opinions, best practices and non-functional requirements.

It's from this library that other developers in your organization will pick and choose from anytime they need to deploy some new capability.

These components make a lot of assumptions about how we've configured our environments. That said, they can still serve as an excellent reference for others.

## Deprecations

Terraform components which are no longer actively maintained are now in the `deprecated/` folder.

Many of these deprecated components are used in our old reference architectures.

We intend to eventually delete, but are leaving them for now in the repo.

## Using `pre-commit` Hooks

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) to enforce consistent Terraform code and documentation. This is accomplished by triggering hooks during `git commit` to block commits that don't pass checks (E.g. format, and module documentation). You can find the hooks that are being executed in the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.

You can install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and this repo's pre-commit hooks on a Mac machine by running the following commands:

```bash
brew install pre-commit gawk terraform-docs coreutils
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Then run the following command to rebuild the docs for all Terraform components:

```bash
make rebuild-docs
```



## Usage



Please take a look at each [component's README](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/) for usage.
